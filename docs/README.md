# Entry-Level Computational Proteomics Lessons

These lessons are designed to serve as a soft introduction to the field of proteomics and the computational challenges therin. Our overall goal in these lessons is to approach proteomics from a computational perspective to help train and attract bioinformatics and computational students into the field. Below are links to currently-available lessons.
