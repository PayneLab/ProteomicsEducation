        "\n",
        "In this lesson, we'll learn about how we can identify the amino acid sequence of peptides in a complex sample. The focus of this lesson, and all lessons, is on data exploration and not the chemistry or engineering of the  mass spectrometer.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Assumptions**\n",
        "\n",
        "It is assumed that the reader has completed the prior lessons and is familiar with basics of biology and introductory chemistry. From the previous lessons, it is critical that you understand the limitations of using m/z and chromatography alone in identification.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Goals**\n",
        "At the end of this lesson, you should be able to:\n",
        "- Understand precursor isolation, fragmentation, and measurement in MS2.\n",
        "- Generate a b/y ion ladder.\n",
        "- Understand the successive mechanics of an LC-MS/MS experiment.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Context**\n",
        "\n",
        "In [Lesson 3](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WvWy2ULWr_9FqyzhbcugisC9qs2J5fzr#scrollTo=MyPfCYIXGjiq), we learned that\n",
        "the more information we have, the easier it is to identify a peptide. We saw that when we put a protein digest in an LC-MS experiment, different peptides have different retention times. This lets us distinguish between multiple peptides even when they have the same m/z value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although LC-MS may help us distinguish between different peptides, it still *doesn't provide enough information* to identify the amino acid sequence of the peptide. In this lesson, we'll learn how to do this with **Tandem Mass Spectrometry** (also known as **MS/MS** and **MS2**).\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Using this Tutorial**\n",
        "\n",
        "This tutorial is designed to be interactive, and you are encouraged to change the code and explore. To do this, you'll need to save a copy of this so that you have editing permissions. Use `File->Save a copy in Drive` to make an editable copy for yourself. Colab notebooks consist of text cells (like this one) and code cells. You interact with the notebook by executing (running) the code cells by clicking the \"play button\" in each cell. You can also run all cells at once by using `Runtime->Run all`.\n",

In this lesson, we introduced a new technique, tandem mass spectrometry, to break apart a peptide into pieces and then measure these pieces. The fragments of a peptide can be used to confidently identify a peptide (much more on this in [Lesson 5](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Weihp1oRIgiXaKwulyeGAcSAuUjb9ihl?usp=sharing)).\n",
